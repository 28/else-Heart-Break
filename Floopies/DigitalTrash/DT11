Letter from Rolf: Orgryte 6 September 1920. 
Hi my love, how's life? Are you listening closely 
and eating enough? Ive been thinking about what 
you said. How come sound affects me so much? I 
think it just brings back so many memories... 

You and me practicing fishing in the meadow 
while the birds sing... The sound of gravel 
when you approached the house from the road...
Would always make me glad! And that's why I just
had to go here and collect some. I hope this 
letter and disk reaches you some day and 
that you can use what I found in youre future 
computer programs. I must admit I dont get it
with all this computers programing stuff but I 
know you love it... 
I just wish i would have found some of those 
music disks i was told existed here...
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places.. 

Anyways, loads of love! // Rolf
