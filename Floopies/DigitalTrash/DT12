On a beech tree rudely carved
NC was here
Why did she do it?
Was she scared or sad?

On a beech tree rudely carved
NC loved me
Why did she do it?
Was she bored, or forced

Do something pretty while you can
Don't be a fool
Reading the gospel to yourself is fine

Do something pretty while you can
Don't be afraid
Skating a pirouette on ice is cool

On a bus stop in town
"We rule the school"
Written for everyone to see and read

On a bus stop in town
"We rule the school"
Written for everyone with eyes in their head

Do something pretty while you can
Don't fall asleep
Driving from California to New York

Call me a prophet if you like
It's no secret
You know the world is made for men
You know the world is made for men
You know the world is made for men
Not us
