Dear Monad,

We need to increase ORE 
quality by 50 - 70 % to
be able to produce modifiers 
in a reliable manner.

Could we hire someone from
your staff who can improve 
the refinement program? 

It's way too bad at the moment, 
this won't do if we are to ramp 
up production and start 
delivering modifiers world-wide.
