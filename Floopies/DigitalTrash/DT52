Neighbour,

I had to leave. It'll probably be a long time 
before you find this.

Didn't have the guts to tell you myself...
Gotta go. Dug too deep. Went too far.
As I slept in my drug induced dreams
And crept beyond borders. I have been destroyed.

She's waiting for me at the 'Outpost'

Yours truly,
Albert
