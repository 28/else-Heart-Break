I've been tracking theseâ€¦ "Ministry" dudes, 
and I think I'm on to something.. 
This is what I've learned:

All computers and crazy machines in the city 
is tapped by the ministry. 
My tests and analysis shows different messages 
hidden in the sounds they are making. 
The ones I've collected and experimented on are:

Electricity 1
Electricity 2   (This one is evil..) 

Guardian         (Guarding the you know what.. the www)

ComputerSound 1
ComputerSound 2
ComputerSound 3  (Cant figure this one out..)
ComputerSound 4 

Thunder 1
Thunder 2

Atmosphere 1   
(Don't know if this is the work of the Ministry)

Atmosphere 2

You can run them on any playable object 
that you can hack. 
Just remember that they may have altered 
the pitch of the object in itself... 
So it might not play at its normal speed. 
Just type PlaySound("SoundName")
