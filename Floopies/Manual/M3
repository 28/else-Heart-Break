*** Chapter 4: Errors ***

When errors are detected, either
during compilation (see floppy 4)
or when the program is running,
execution will stop and the error
will be presented in the "help area",
the lower part of the modifier window.

In case of a runtime error it's
possible to start the program again,
either by activating the object
or by compiling the code again.
