- We have to escape! 
- Escape?! 
- It's called "we gotta split"! 
- But why we gotta do that for?! 
- Come on, the old guy's gonna call the cops! 
- Yeah so what? 
- We took a lot of food, 
  coffee, 
  drinks! 
- Listen, we're shipwrecked right? 
- Yeah...
- Exactly, so then we're allowed to "Knobb" 
  other people's stash, but alright...  
  ...all hands on deck!
