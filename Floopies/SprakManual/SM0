#####################################

Programming, what a wonderful thing! 
Ah... the joy of controlling everything and 
anything through the magical spells of code alone.

This manual will teach you all you need to
know to become a sorcerer of bits, a
a master of logic and the ruler of both 
data and functions.

There are 10 chapters and we recommend
you read them all in order, since
the later chapters build upon previous material.
Here's an overview of what we will go through:

------------------------
1.  Introduction to problem solving
2.  Variables
3.  Math
4.  Functions
5.  If-statements
6.  Arrays
7.  Loops
8.  Handling text
9.  Objects and methods
------------------------

The language you will learn is called SPRAK.
We hope that you will find it fun and 
enlightening to use!
