Chapter 3 --- Math
==================

Don't let this chapter scare you! You don't
need to be a math whiz to do programming.
Curiosity and logical thinking will take you
much further, trust me.

Still, it is often very useful to perform
different kinds of math operations in your
code.

The basic ones are:

+  # plus
-  # minus
*  # multiplication
/  # division

These operations can be used in the
following manner:

number x = 10 + 20
number y = x * 2
number z = y - 1

Now x will have the value 30, y will be 60
and z will be 59. Make sure you understand
why this is and how each variable depends
on the one defined before it.

You can also construct more complex, compound
math statements like the following one:

x = 10 / y * z + 1

The operators follow regular operator precedence,
which means that  the * and / will be calculated
before + and - .

To change this, parenthesis can be used:

x = 10 / y * (z + 1)

Different computer systems might have other math 
operations available as FUNCTIONS (see Chapter 5).

There are some more math operators that are quite
handy, like the following ones:

<   # less than
<=  # less than or equal
>   # greater than
>=  # greater than or equal
==  # equal
!=  # not equal

They are used similarly to +, -, * and / but
return true or false as their result:

30 < 20  # false
5 <= 5   # true
100 != 0 # true
