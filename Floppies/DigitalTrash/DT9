Any effectively generated theory capable of
expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both 
consistent and complete. In particular, for any 
consistent, effectively generated formal theory
that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, 
there is an arithmetical statement that is true, 
but not provable in the theory.
