Elsy's diary: 7 September 1922.
-------------
I have been admiring these fascinating 
creatures all my life..

Every time we visited Kungalv I would listen, 
and look... 

And then we would run out in the woods 
to pick chanterelles...
How I would chase you round 
and round the house...

If my memories don't fail me our 
favorite song was called "HoneyBee"? 

Remember Inge humming it and telling us
about his Police carrier? 
Oh, sweet music to my ears... 
Just like the buzzing of tiny wings.
