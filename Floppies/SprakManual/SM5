Chapter 5 --- If statements
===========================

Time for some fun! The if statement is
a central part of what makes computers
able to "think". It selects different paths 
through the code, depending on if 
something is true or not. Kind of like
a railroad switch with a little guy 
checking which way the current train should go.

For example, let's say that we have a variable
named 'SECRET', containing either the value 
'true' or 'false', we don't know which.

How can we find out?!
By using an if-statement of course:

if SECRET
    Print("true!")
end

There are several interesting things to note
here. First of all the use of the two words
'if' and 'end'. These two go together like
a pair. The 'end' word shows where the block
of code ends. Everything in between will happen
if the variable called 'SECRET' contains the 
value 'true'. In this case it will print "true!".
On the other hand, if the variable contains 
'false' nothing will happen at all.

What if we want to print something in that 
case too? Here's one way to do it:

if SECRET
    Print("true!")
else
    Print("false!")
end

You could do several things in the block 
between 'if' and 'end'. Don't be confused by
the text being moved a bit to the right, that's
just for readability.

if SECRET
    Print("The")
    Print("SECRET")
    Print("is")
    Print("true!")
end

It is possible to have even more cases
by using the following notation:

if a
    # do something
else if b
    # do something else
else if c
    # do this if c is true (but a and b are false)
else
    # do this if a, b and c are all false
end


Finally, several variables or expressions 
containing logical values (true / false) 
can be checked together using the word 'and'
and 'or':

if a and (b or c)
    # this will happen if a and b
    # OR a and c are true
end

Don't worry if this seems confusing, just
come back later and re-read any section
that didn't make sense the first time.
