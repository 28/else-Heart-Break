Chapter 7 --- Loops
===================

Loops are used to make a block of code
run over and over again, like this:

loop
    Print("Hello!")
end

This will keep on printing "Hello!" forever
and ever, or at least until someone turns off 
the computer, or something like that...

A loop can also be interrupted from inside
using the 'break' keyword:

loop
    if IsDone()
        break
    end
end
Print("Done!")

This code will keep looping until the function
'IsDone' returns true, upon which execution will
continue below the loop and the program 
will print "Done!".

A loop can also loop "through" an array. This is 
very simple, just add the array after the 'loop' keyword:

loop [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    # do something five times
end

Usually you want to access the elements in the array.
Then you have to give it a name:

array a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

loop x in a
    Print(x)
end

This will print each thing that is stored in the array!
If you want to loop through a range of numbers, say 0 up
to 100 you can do that with the 'from' ... 'to' keywords:

loop x from 0 to 100
    Print(x)
end

This is much more efficient than creating an array with
all those numbers in it.
