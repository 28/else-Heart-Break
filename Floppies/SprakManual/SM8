Chapter 8 --- Manipulating text
===============================

SPRAK's tools for manipulating text
are few and kind of simplistic. It's still
important to know them though. Without
good textual output and input a lot of
programs would suffer from very poor usability.

The most important operation is representing 
different kinds of data as text.
This is usually automatically done whenever
a function needs text. For example
the print function:

Print(10)

This will output the text "10", just as expected.
Somewhat more interesting is the '+' operator
which can be used to put together longer
strings:

Print("X has the value " + X)

This will automatically convert X to a
string and print something like 
"X has the value 42", if X has the value 42.

You can also print arrays but if they are
long they might get cut off half-way through
to fit on the screen and not create
enormous strings.
