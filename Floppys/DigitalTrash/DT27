They're on to mee....---

They know what I have stolen, but they don't 
know how I managed to make it work! I think they're coming. 
I need to run! The "thing" is hidden where the wind 
always blows and then you need to go inside.

It wasn't safe to put the 
two of them in the same place...

If i don't make it, remember to keep fighting!
