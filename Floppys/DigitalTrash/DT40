You've picked a very sunny and private place to grow

You have easy access to this space

You can bring water to your plants when needed

You're sure no one else knows about the spot. 
As far as privacy, try leaving a few $5 bills in the area, 
come back a few weeks later, if the $5 bills are still around, 
you have some evidence that no one else 
has visited this spot since you left.
