====================
There are a few things 
to think about in life.
====================

- It's easy to lose track 
   of oneself 
   if one does not have routines 
   such as sleeping regularly. 
   Maybe not always 
   but at least sometimes. 
   Or just drink 
   a lot of coffeeee....
   
- Be curious! 
   Poking your nose around 
   in various things,
   and also perhaps 
   where it shouldn't be,
   is not a bad thing necessarily. 
   It's just that old people
   seem to forget the importance 
   of these things.
   
- You don't always have to sleep 
   in your own bed. 
   Sometimes you can find 
   a derelict bed 
   when you're out and about 
   in the most peculiar places. 
   Don't be afraid to take a nap. 
   
- Do whatever you want. 
   ANY fool can make a rule,
   and any fool can break it. 
   So, have fun!

   PS. I know for a fact
   that sometimes
   they forget to lock
   the door behind the
   reception desk. DS
