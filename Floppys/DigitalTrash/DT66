So you found the teleporting device?
Or did you slurp your way here? 
Oh well, I'm impressed... 

The floppy with all the 
World Positions sure was helpful wasn't it?
If you found it that is.. 
I managed to escape the time 
I wrote that other note, 
managed to escape to this place of refuge, 
safety or sanctuary if you would like to 
call it that.. 

The ministry never found me here. 
This place is beyond their control and reach. 

Some one said: 
As long as we keep our head and voice high 
and rhythm going the melody will follow. 
Im looking for my melody.. 

I sure hope we all can find our melody someday.. 
All these commercial ones sounds the same 
anyways..  

If you're reading this I probably 
didn't make it back. 


Too bad. I left the loop running..
