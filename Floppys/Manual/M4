*** Chapter 2: The Compiler ***

A compiler is a program that takes 
source code in the form of 
text and transforms it into
something that can be executed 
by the computer.

If any errors are discovered
during the compilation step
they will be presented to the
programmer in the "help area",
the lower part of the modifier.
