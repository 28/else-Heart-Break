Jonkoping 13 September 1909.

When flying in my Hansa S12 and S17 over the Swedish 
woods I used to admire the fascinating animals that are
still around. I hope my grandchildren get the chance to
see and experience them as I did. In harmony I guess... 
The song "Wolf" is almost loud enough for me to play 
and listen to when I'm flying... Well, that's all for now, 
need to call my wife. Apparently B and C are up to 
no good.
