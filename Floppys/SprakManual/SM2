Chapter 2 --- Variables
=======================

Variables are used for naming things. This might
seem like a trivial task but do not be deceived,
the ability to name things is one
of the most important things of all in programming.
The reason for this is that it allows us to
abstract and handle the components of our solution
in a symbolic way.

For example: instead of referring to your name as
a string of characters like "Lisa" we can create
a variable containing this value. The variable
might be called something like 'name' and could
even refer to different names at different points
in time, depending on the needs of the program.

Here are some examples of how to create variables:

number x = 10
string myName = "Simon"
bool itIsChristmas = false

Notice the words to the left, like 'number', 'string'
and 'bool'. Those are TYPES and they describe what
kind of data we want to put inside the variable.
After that comes the variable name. This should be
something descriptive that explains what kind of thing
we have put inside the variable.

Next up is the equal sign, '='
This means that we set the value of the variable to
whatever is on the right side.

Variables can be re-set to other values by using the
equal sign, like this:

x = 11
myName = "Simone"
itIsChristmas = true

This requires the variables to have already been declared
earlier in the program using the syntax above with
a type and a name (like 'number x = 10' for example).

If a variable contains a number type it can be changed
in some additional ways just for convenience, saving
a few key strokes:

x++      # Increase by one
x += 10  # Increase by 10
x--      # Decrease by one
x -= 20  # Decrease by 20
