Chapter 6 --- Arrays
====================

Arrays are a way of combining several values into
one structure that can be manipulated and passed
around as a single unit. It's very handy!

Here's one way to create an array:

array numbers = [10, 5, 7, 123]

The '[' and ']' surround the numbers or whatever
you want to put into the array, kind of like the 
sides of a box or something...

This array (called 'numbers') now contains the
four numbers 10, 5, 7 and 123. We can get them out 
of the variable by using the indexing operator,
which looks like this:

Print(numbers[0])
Print(numbers[1])
Print(numbers[2])
Print(numbers[3])

This will print each one of the "slots" in the array,
starting with the '10' in the first slot and ending with
'123' in the last one. Note that the indexing of the
array starts at 0 and ends at 3. This is a weird standard
that most programming languages follow and you just 
need to accept that it feels a bit strange.

The indexing operator can also be used to assign new values
to somewhere in the array:

numbers[1] = 666

Now the 'numbers' variable will contain [10, 666, 7, 123]
Be careful with this so you don't create bugs! Manipulating
arrays in this way can be tricky.

There is a function called 'Count' that 
counts how many things there are in an array. 
Just pass the array to 'Count' like this:

Count(numbers)   # the function returns 4 in this case

There are more tricks and functions that use
arrays but this is a good start.
