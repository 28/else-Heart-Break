Chapter 9 --- Objects and methods
=================================

This is the final and perhaps most exciting
chapter of this whole manual. We have now
reached the most powerful construct of
Sprak, the dot operator.

The dot operator is used to call functions
in OTHER objects. These functions are usually
called methods to differentiate them from
normal functions. 

Since such a method can do things to
the object it is attached to, and even call
other methods in other objects, the power
that comes with the dot operator is immense.

Please wield it carefully and try not to make a mess.

Here's how you use it. First connect to
another object:

var o = Connect("HomeComputer")

Then use the connection
(stored in the variable 'o' in this case)
together with the dot operator to call a method:

o.Print("Hello at home!")

This will make the computer that you connected
to print the message "Hello at home!" on its
monitor. 

This requires access to the internet, naturally.
