# else Heart.Break()

This repository is a collection of stuff that I found helpful and interesting to
store while playing else Heart.Break() game.

Check out the game here if you are not familiar: [elseheartbreak.com](http://elseheartbreak.com/).
Language of the scripts is *Sprak*, the hacking language of the game.

## Explanation

Since the game enables us to copy-paste code and text in and out i copied out
everything I thought it will be useful or just simply interesting to study. These mostly include all floppies that I stumbled upon and some codes hacked 
from various devices. Also I saved some codes I wrote/modified during the game.
Files with prefix Origin_ are unchanged game codes and those with Hacked_ have
been more or less modified or created by me.

There are more floppies in the game (look at the game files) but these were the most interesting to me so I wanted to have them in one place. At the end of the game I just copied the missing one from game files (to complete the collection :)).

## My impression of the game

I find the game quite original, fun and challenging. I would recommend it to
everyone who likes this kind of game. I would also recommend it to both newbie
and experienced programmers/hackers and even non programmers for the purpose of
learning in a very fun way.

The fun comes in the form of exploring the world and hacking the life out of
every object possible. Exploring comes tight with collecting all the pieces of
data you stumble upon. By "digging" through the Digital Trash I found a lot of
stuff that helped me progress the game even though most of it is useless for the
story but vital for the game "feel" itself. When it comes to the story itself
it is really original and catchy but in my opinion not completed - not worked
out completely. There is room for more elaboration in almost every part of the
story. Also the story progression is kinda bad, sometimes I would walk for hours
in circles trying to figure out what to do next. But that didn't come hard on
me because it was fun the every minute of it.

All in all it's a great game to play and to study from the game design, game
play design, game and game world philosophy and game programming at all. A
certain recommend to everyone in need of a challenge.
