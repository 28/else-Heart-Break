# else Heart.Break()

**This repository contains spoilers!**

This repository is a collection of stuff that I found helpful
and interesting to store while playing [*else Heart.Break()*](http://elseheartbreak.com/)
game. Buy the game [here](https://www.gog.com/en/game/else_heartbreak).

Most of the files are in *Sprak*, the hacking/programming language of the game.

## Repository layout

While playing the game I collected every bit of information I found
and put it in this repository. Every floppy I found is in the [Floppies](/Floppies)
repository folder. After the first playthrough I added the remaining floppies
from the game files just to complete the collection.

I have copied any interesting code to the [Original](/Code/Original) folder verbatim.
It is easier to analyze it outside the game.

All the code that I've written is in the [Hacked](/Code/Hacked) folder.

## Usage

The game allows copy-pasting the code from outside the game.
It's a bit easier to use a 'real' text editor when writing *Sprak* code.
I use [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) text editor with
a [plug-in](https://github.com/Eforen/sublime-syntax-sprak) designed just for *Sprak*.
It supports syntax highlighting and code completion.

## Gameplay

Advice: **"Hack the planet!"**

Fun fact: *The entire game can be hacked!* Check the game installation folder.
